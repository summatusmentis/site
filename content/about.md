I\'m currently 24 years old, and just starting my 3rd year as a PhD student.

During my undergraduate career at the [University of Minnesota -
Morris](http://www.morris.umn.edu/academics/computerscience/), I focused my work
primarily on [OpenAFS](http://www.openafs.org) and distributed systems,
completing 2 years of Google Summer of Code (2008 and 2009), as well as a summer
REU at Carnegie Mellon working on [Internet Suspend and
Resume](http://isr.cmu.edu).

After these experiences, my interests broadened to technology that has a more
direct impact societally.

My research interests encompass mobile computing, and the role that mobile
devices can play in affecting social change. I currently work on CitizenSense, a
smartphone and web platform for crowdsourcing real-world data gathering, for use
by non-profits, advocacy groups, and local municipalities.
